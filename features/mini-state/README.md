State that allows you to use any external programs. 
e.g. use 
[The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) 
with `ag`. Depend State means the state depends on the machine 
you are currently on.


### Cross State

State that uses universal solution from the DependState. Instead 
of using 
[The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) 
with `ag`, we use `isearch` for searching implementation. Cross 
State means the state that allows you to use the same method 
to does job.
