You are able to search the buffer you want in the `*Buffer List*` 
buffer using `tabulated-list`'s faker header feature. This feature 
is basically the same as using `helm` interface and call 
`switch-to-buffer` related commands but with different interfaace. 
I personally recommend this way so once I am in the `buffer-menu`; 
I have the full control altering the buffer list.

**Edit 1:** After version `5.8.3`, this feature supports using 
`flx` for filtering/searching. This update increased the 
accuracy for the search result.
