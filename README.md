> Emacs configuration works across all OSs

This is Jen-Chieh Shen's emacs configuration started from [Casey Muratori](https://github.com/cmuratori)'s
Emacs configuration. It has been repeatedly utilized and modified
since 2015 and is now very different from his configuration.

I wouldn't claim this is the best Emacs config, but this is the
best config to myself. If you wish to learn Emacs, this could be
a good start, because this configuration has been rewritten
basically from scratch. Hopefully, this config will help someone
who is new or struggle to Emacs. This configuration should work
on most OSs, indicating Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Emacs itself supports multiple programming languages. I managed
all the programming languages I personally used. I dabble in
numerous technologies, incorporating hardware, firmware, and software.
Here is the list of programming languages I know and are extended
from this configuration.

* ActionScript 2.0 or 3.0 / Ada / Agda / AppleScript / Assembly Language
* BASIC / Batchfile / Beancount
* C / C++ / C# / Clojure / / COBOL / Common Lisp / Crystal / CSS / CUDA / Cython
* Dart / Dockerfile
* Elixir / Elm / Emacs Lisp / Erlang
* F# / Fountain
* GLSL / Go / GDScript / Groovy
* Haskell / Haxe / HLSL / HTML
* Idris / INI
* Java / JavaScript / JSON / JSX / Julia
* Kotlin
* LESS / Lisp / Lua
* Makefile / Markdown / Mermaid / Mint
* Nim / Nix / Noir
* Object Pascal (Delphi) / Objective-C / OCaml
* P4 / Pascal / Perl / PHP / PowerShell / Properties / Python
* R / Racket / Ruby / Rust
* Sass / Scala / SCSS / ShaderLab / Shell script / SQL / Swift
* Terraform / TOML / TSX / TypeScript
* Verilog / VHDL / Vimscript / Vue
* XML
* YAML
* Zig

This configuration polished and goes toward to the modern
text editor, or even better, it goes beyond modern IDE.
e.g. [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/),
[Sublime Text 2](https://www.sublimetext.com/2) or [3](https://www.sublimetext.com/),
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), etc.

## 📚 Philosophy

I have experienced many different kinds of IDEs and text editors. But I’ve had a
hard time finding the best tool to use. I’ve jumped from one working field to
another trying to find something that suits my needs. So instead of struggling
with the tool itself, I chose Emacs and configured the entire thing from scratch,
to suit my needs.

Here are a few goals that I want this config to accomplish.

* Having the same set of key bindings across different IDEs and text editors as
many as possible.
* Having the same font and theme across different OSs and environments.
* Automating trivial or redundant tasks.
* Improve user experiences approach to modern text editor or IDE.
* Make compatible with most features work inside the terminal as well.

Having these implementations makes my life easier, and having a genuinely portable
workspace, which is great because it lets me work on different machines efficiently,
without having to get used to a new IDE.

## 📰 News

Here is the list of few essential and recent changes to this configuration.

* `9.0.2` - Replace package `topsy` with `breadcrumb-mode` for better UX
* `8.2.2` - Add `emp` as the default Music Player
* `8.2.1` - Replace package `docstr` with `ts-docstr` for better parsing capability
* `8.2.0` - Drop support for Emacs 27.x
* `8.1.0` - Remove config tabify/untabify save, and replace it with `whitespace-cleanup-mode`.
* `8.0.1` - Switch from `ivy` to `vertico`.
* `8.0.0` - Move everything to `.emacs.d`. ([#32](https://github.com/jcs-emacs/jcs-emacs/pull/32))
* `7.1.0` - Replace `quelpa` with `github-elpa`.
* `7.0.0` - Switch from [quickhelp](https://github.com/company-mode/company-quickhelp) to [box](https://github.com/sebastiencs/company-box) for company frontend.
* `6.5.0` - Add pinned archive feature to package module.

## 💾 Installation

To install, clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`, i.e. ensure that the `init.el`
contained in this repo ends up at `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcs-emacs/jcs-emacs ~/.emacs.d
```

Then startup Emacs; will automatically install all necessary packages due
to this configuration.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **MAKE SURE YOU INSTALLED THE CORRECT VERSION OF EMACS!**

## 🕒 Startup Time

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcs-emacs/badges/master/config/speed/dos.svg)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcs-emacs/badges/master/config/speed/mac.svg)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcs-emacs/badges/master/config/speed/unix.svg)
(in seconds)

The average startup time for this configuration is around `15` to `25` seconds.
You can use the command `emacs-init-time` to check the startup time on your machine.
Not quite sure what causes that much performance, hopefully, I'm able to lower
the startup time down to `5` to `15` seconds.

**Edit 1:** After version `5.3.2`, the average startup time is around `5` to `15`
seconds. Solved this issue by removing the unnecessary `require` keyword load file
and using `:defer` keyword with `use-package` package to delay some packages
load time.

📝 *P.S. Here is a great article about
[Speeding Up Emacs](https://anuragpeshne.github.io/essays/emacsSpeed.html)
written by
[Anurag Peshne](https://github.com/anuragpeshne).*

**Edit 2:** Using [esup](https://github.com/jschaf/esup) package to test and
optimize the configuration. Call `package-refresh-contents` only when package
installation is needed. By doing the thing, lower the startup time from around
`4` to `8` seconds.

📝 *P.S. Some good hints from one [StackExchange](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/)
question,
[What can I do to speed up my start-up?](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/2286/what-can-i-do-to-speed-up-my-start-up)
answered by
[Jordon Biondo](https://github.com/jordonbiondo).*

📝 *P.S. The above cases are tested on Windows. Other OSs are not Windows should
start within a second.*
