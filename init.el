;; A second, case-insensitive pass over `auto-mode-alist' is time wasted, and
;; indicates misconfiguration (don't rely on case insensitivity for file names).
(setq auto-mode-case-fold nil)

;; Disable bidirectional text scanning for a modest performance boost. I've set
;; this to `nil' in the past, but the `bidi-display-reordering's docs say that
;; is an undefined state and suggest this to be just as good:
(setq-default bidi-display-reordering 'left-to-right
              bidi-paragraph-direction 'left-to-right)

;; Disabling the BPA makes redisplay faster, but might produce incorrect display
;; reordering of bidirectional text with embedded parentheses and other bracket
;; characters whose 'paired-bracket' Unicode property is non-nil.
(setq bidi-inhibit-bpa t)

;; More performant rapid scrolling over unfontified regions. May cause brief
;; spells of inaccurate syntax highlighting right after scrolling, which should
;; quickly self-correct.
(setq fast-but-imprecise-scrolling t)

;; Don't ping things that look like domain names.
(setq ffap-machine-p-known 'reject)

;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the
;; font. By inhibiting this, we halve startup times, particularly when we use
;; fonts that are larger than the system default (which would resize the frame).
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t
      frame-resize-pixelwise t)

;; Emacs "updates" its ui more often than it needs to, so slow it down slightly
(setq idle-update-delay 1.0)  ; default is 0.5

;; Font compacting can be terribly expensive, especially for rendering icon
;; fonts on Windows. Whether disabling it has a notable affect on Linux and Mac
;; hasn't been determined, but do it there anyway, just in case. This increases
;; memory usage, however!
(setq inhibit-compacting-font-caches t)

;; Increase how much is read from processes in a single chunk (default is 4kb).
;; This is further increased elsewhere, where needed (like our LSP module).
(setq read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024))  ; 1MB

;; Introduced in Emacs HEAD (b2f8c9f), this inhibits fontification while
;; receiving input, which should help a little with scrolling performance.
(setq redisplay-skip-fontification-on-input t)

;; Reduce *Message* noise at startup. An empty scratch buffer (or the dashboard)
;; is more than enough.
